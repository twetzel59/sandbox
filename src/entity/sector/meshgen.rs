//! Implements mesh generation for sectors.
//!
//! Each sector is a small rendererable chunk of the voxel world,
//! and is assigned a VAO in the form of a ``Tesselation``.
//! This module provides the logic that generates a list of vertex
//! attributes from a list of voxels.
//!
//! In other words, it makes models for the sectors.
